    <ul class="chart-container">
      <li class="chart-item">
        <img class="resizing-image" src="img/stacked_bar_chart.png" />
        <p class="padded">The data types in this stacked bar chart are categorical attributes representing the larger category that is broken down into the smaller ones, also representing the categories on the x-axis. The bar chart also uses quantitative attributes on the y-axis to measure the amount of each category. The marks used are lines which are items representing each individual bar. The channels used include color to differentiate each smaller category, position (as the bars are vertical), and size of each smaller category in a given bar.</p>
      </li>

      <li class="chart-item">
        <img class="resizing-image" src="img/mind_map.png" />

        <p class="padded">The data types for this mind map include categorical attributes representing the branching ideas, as well as links from the theme to each idea. The marks include points which are nodes, and lines from these points representing links. The channels used include color to differentiate the theme from the ideas, as well as position since all the ideas center around the theme.</p>
      </li>

      <li class="chart-item">
        <img class="resizing-image" src="img/bump_chart.png" />
        <p class="padded">The data types for this bump chart are ordinal attributes because this visualization shows changes in rank which have been logged over time. The marks used include points, which are nodes, and lines which represent links. The channels used include color to differentiate the different items, and position to show each item's change in rank over time.</p>
      </li>

      <li class="chart-item">
        <img class="resizing-image" src="img/bubble_and_pie_chart.png" />
        <p class="padded">The data types in the bubble and pie chart are attributes representing quantitative values on the axes, as well as attributes representing categorical data in the charts themselves. The marks used include areas (slices of pie), and points (each chart represents a point). All of these marks are items. The channels used in this image are color (each slice of pie), tilt (angles of each slice of pie), and size (of each chart).</p>
